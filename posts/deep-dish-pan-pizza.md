Notes:
- This is a modification of the pan pizza recipe from [https://basicswithbabish.co/basicsepisodes/pizza-dough](https://basicswithbabish.co/basicsepisodes/pizza-dough)
- Makes enough dough for one pizza using a 10" cast iron skillet.

Ingredients:
- 210g bread flour
- 0.5 tsp yeast
- 149g water
- 13mL olive oil
- 4g kosher salt

Directions:
1. In a bowl, combine bread flour and yeast.
2. Add water and olive oil. Mix to combine.
3. Then, add kosher salt and continue mixing until no dry spots remain. Use the lift and fold technique to develop the gluten. Let the dough rest in an oiled container overnight in the refrigerator.
4. Lubricate cast iron skillet with 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil. Place dough inside of the skillet. Flip the dough to coat it with oil and press it out to fill the bottom of the pan.
5. Depending on how cold your dough is, you may experience some resistance. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rest for 15 minutes before trying again. Once it is shaped, it should be out of the refrigerator for about an hour and a half before topping and baking.
6. Preheat oven to 500F (use pizza stone if possible)
7. Add sauce to the dough followed by mozzarella and pepperoni.
9. Place the pizza into the oven for 15 minutes. Rotate the pan at 8 minutes. Check at 12 minutes and remove early if the top looks ready. 
10. After baking, let the pizza rest for 10 minutes to absorb the oil. If the bottom texture is not crunchy enough, place it in the cast iron skillet on the stovetop over medium heat for 2-3 minutes until the bottom is crisp. Slice and serve as desired.
