Notes:
- This is a modification of the Neapolitan pizza recipe from [https://thepizzaheaven.com/neapolitan-pizza-in-home-oven/](https://thepizzaheaven.com/neapolitan-pizza-in-home-oven/)
- Makes enough dough for three pizzas
- Higher hydration, sugar, and oil help improve the crust with the lower temperature and longer bake time in a home oven
- Pizzas are baked in two stages to allow enough time for the crust to bake without burning toppings
- High hydration dough can be very difficult to work with. Use a generous amount of flour when preparing the dough for transfer. Dust off excess flour between the initial bake and topping

Ingredients:
- 450g Tipo 00 flour
- 0.33 tsp yeast
- 300g water
- 15 mL olive oil
- 15g kosher salt
- 10g sugar

Directions:
1. Add flour and yeast to a large mixing bowl and whisk together.
2. In a separate bowl, dissolve the salt and sugar in the water.
3. Add the water to the flour and mix until a single mass of dough forms.
4. Add the oil, and work it into the dough.
5. Knead the dough by hand for 15-20 minutes, or in a stand mixer at low speed for 10-15 minutes.
7. Leave the dough covered to rest for 15-30 minutes.
8. Fold the dough over itself a few times and form a smooth, round dough.
9. Place the dough in a bowl covered in plastic wrap, and let it rise at room temperature for around 14 hours. Alternately, leave in the fridge for up to 5 days. This is the bulk fermentation phase.
10. After the bulk fermentation, take out the dough and cut it into 3 dough balls. Make sure the dough balls are smooth and even to get round, nice pizzas.
11. Place the dough balls in individual bowls covered in plastic wrap and allow them to proof for at least one hour before baking. Preheat the pizza steel at 500F for at least 40 minutes.
12. Place a dough ball in a small pile of flour to make the dough less sticky. Spread a generous amount of flour on the pizza peel to enable a smooth launch onto the pizza steel.
13. Stretch out the pizza and place it on the peel. Apply sauce and then launch the pizza on to the steel for the initial bake of ~5 minutes.
14. Remove the pizza from the oven and dust any excess flour from the bottom of the pizza before adding cheese and other toppings.
15. Put the pizza back into the oven for the second bake (use the broiler if needed)
